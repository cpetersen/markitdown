  A <a href="http://blog.smartbear.com/careers/how-to-speak-to-a-technical-person/">smart bear writes about how to talk to a technical person</a>. Some of these points really hit home for me. When I'm with my friends, I get sarcasm, but in interactions where I don't expect it, it often goes over my head. Also ambiguous pronouns are one of my biggest pet peeves both in technical and casual conversation. For instance, &quot;My friend was talking to her boss, she said X&quot;. Did your friend say X, or her boss?

                <div style="overflow:hidden;">
                    <span style="line-height: 1.5625;">Try to avoid using vague words like "one" or "it" to describe an issue. For example:<i style="line-height: 1.5625;">"When I opened the document, the content was askew. When I tried to print the document, the printer jammed up.<b>It</b>cannot blow up like that!"</i><span style="line-height: 1.5625;">In the last sentence of this example, are you complaining about the document or the printer? It's not really clear. So I would repeat myself even at the risk of sounding redundant. It's better to be redundant and clear than to leave the other person wondering.</span><br/>
